Programming 2- Final project
Creation: The creation of this project started out as failed ideas until we thought of our best one
Issue: As a team of 3, we we're tasked to create a project from scratch that can successfully collaborate 3 classes to create one project.
however, our 3rd team member disappeared with out Brandon or I knowing, therefore we had to revamp our idea to something we can both do.
We thought Metric-imperial converter was good but converting currency is even better. So, with our time left we successfully coded our converter.
